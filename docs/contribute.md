## Getting Started

-   Fork the Repository:

Click the "Fork" button on the top-right corner of the repository page.
This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

-   Clone the Forked Repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
    cd repository-name
    ```

-   Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have the required libraries installed. There are separate `/backend` and `/frontend` directories, each with it's own list of dependancies. Navigate to both of them and run:

```bash
npm install
```

You can view the required libraries by running:

```bash
npm list
```

## Set Up Environment:

If you open the `/.gitignore` file in the root of the project you will see listed `.env` file. `.env` files usually holds environment variables. Here is the list of important variables for both backend and front end. Consider this to be sensitive data.

```bash
// mongoDB connection string
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://your_username:your_password@cluster_url/db_name" # online cluster
LOCALHOST="mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/<database_name>" # localhost for development
```

To read the data from the `.env` files:

```js
import "dotenv/config";
console.log(process.env.VARIABLE_NAME);
```

## How to Contribute

-   Look for open issues.
-   Propose new features or improvements by creating a new issue or discussing them in an existing one.

## Branching Strategy

Will follow github flow model:

-   Always work on a new branch. Use descriptive names, such as:
    -   `feature/employee-scheduling`
    -   `fix/bug-in-schedule-generator`
-   Base your branch on the `main` branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name main
    ```

-   Keep your branch updated by pulling changes from the `main` branch regularly:

    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    git rebase origin/main
    ```

-   Avoid committing directly to the `main` branch.

## Code Guidelines

-   Follow the coding style of the project by formating the code offten. Use the `eslint.config.js` that will hold the list of defined rules.
-   Write clear, concise, and self-documenting code.
-   Ensure your changes do not introduce new linting errors or warnings.

    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
-   Open the `package.json` file and look at the list of available scripts. To run the script, simply run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run <script_name>
    ```

## Commit Messages

```
